# Surfs Up Analysis

## Overview
This analysis was done to determine if the weather in Oahu is suitable for opening a surf and ice cream shop business year-round. Weather data stored in a SQLite database were used to find the average temperature for both June and December to determine if the weather is suitable.

* The first key difference between weather in June and December is that mean temperature for December(71 degrees) is lower than the mean temperature for June(74 degrees).

## Summary
In summary, the weather in Oahu in both June and December is favorable, with average temperatures ranging around the 70s, and lowest and highest temperatures in the 60s and 80s. December is, on average, a few degrees cooler than June; however, the climate data for the two months is very similar, suggesting that year-round climate conditions are suitable for business operations. Two additional queries to determine the suitability of the climate in Oahu are 1) finding the average amount of precipitation for June and December and 2) finding the average temperature for each month of the year.
